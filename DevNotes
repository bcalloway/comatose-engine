The move to Desert from an Engines plugin required the following 
location changes:

routes.rb  => config/desert_routes.rb
        - This file is kind of an include file for a 
          route mapper, and is not stand alone.
engine_config/* => config
engine_plugins/* => plugins
assets/* => public

In order to move to Desert from Engines, we had to hack a 
couple of things.

init.rb - Inserted some hacks to Desert::Plugin to handle our
          way of doing migrations. These hacks were copied from
          from CommunityEngine's conversion.

lib/comatose_engine.rb
        - Changes Engines.for_plugin to Desert::Manager.find_plugin
          when checking for pending migrations.
        - requires 'rails_asset_extensions'

lib/rails_asset_extensions
        - This contains a code from the Engines Plugin to
          handle copying assets from the plugin's public
          directory to the global public/plugin_assets 
          directory. 
          TODO: Explore using "desert_assets".
